This application was build to learn react, state management, drag&drop, animations, usage of colorpicker, how to copy to clipboard, how to use mui, react navigation, and route animations.
Application is based upon flatuicolors. It allows user to see available palettes, remove unwanted palettes and add new ones. After user clicks on the palette, he can choose one of the colors to copy the value of it. User can also change the format of the color using the switch in top right of the site and change the opacity of the colors using the slider in top left corner. User is also able to add a new palette. Inside of the form, user can generate random color, choose one from the picker, remove chosen color, clear whole palette and change position of the colors inside of palette, that will be saved. After choosing all the colors user has to choose a unique name for palette and the emoji. Next he is transitioned back to home screen where user can find added palette.
Project was build using react, react-router, dnd-kit, emoij-mart, mui, chroma-js, rc-slider, react-color, react-copy-to-clipboard, react-transition-group.
